JNotepad
========

A complete remake of Windows Notepad in Java using Swing.

Remembers location, size, word wrapping, font, status bar visibility on close and restores them the next time you open.
Has print, find, go to, replace, undo, select all, status bar, and view help functionality.
The only menu item not implemented is Page Setup, which is unnecessary because the textArea.print() dialog has a tab for Page Setup. 
A complete replication of Windows Notepad in Java.
